# Not_A_Doorbell
This is a project aimed to build a custom "HotKey" board or mini Keyboard, using the raspberry pi pico (rp2040), an old recyceld controller (can by replaced with a standart alps encoder) and a qmc firmware. The used switches are cherry MX and compatiblt options.  It also uses RGB leds for some sweet lighing effects. 

# The Goal of the Project

I had purched a old "Video schnittpult" second hand (Televela T701), to use the housing and some of the parts for a different Project. However, the very nice encoder (also nown as jog/shutter wheel) was not realy needte.


# PCB and Scematic

The pcb is designt in KiCad and manufacured by JLC PCB in china. THE CUURENT VERSION OF THIS PCB HAS SOME ISSUES! the issues are:
- Missing resistors for clampung voltage to 3.3 on the imput of the pico
- wrong hole placment of the lower mountung hole from the encoder
- general mounting hole misplacment

# Enclusure
- the optiginal idear for the hosing was to use wood, however in the current state that could by difficult to do with the mashines i have acsess to. 
- a STL housing that could by 3d Printet as well as a keyplate is in development
- there is a possibility for a CNC carved housung 

# ToDo 
- Fix the PCB
- Create the software
- Upload Pictures 
- Create the STL Files for the case
